# Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze clinical health data and predict the likelihood of heart disease. The objective is to support early risk assessment by identifying patterns in patient medical attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle:

**Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset**  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alicvdr/heart-csv)

The dataset contains clinical and demographic features related to cardiovascular health.  
*The dataset is not included in this repository due to Kaggle’s data usage policy.*

## Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature-target separation
4. Train-test split
5. Model training
6. Performance evaluation and comparison
